# Random Commands

Before, I put a lot of files on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/). However, it started to
get mixing with random topics. So I just want to put all scripts in one place.
Mostly, these are commands related to bash, text editor and Python.

Check out these following markdown files.

- [Homebrew](docs/homebrew.md)
- [Macports with Python](docs/macports.md)
- [Python with Anaconda](docs/anaconda.md)
- [PySpark](docs/pyspark.md)
- [Vim](docs/vim.md)
- [Git customization](docs/git_customization.md)
- [Cowsay on terminal](docs/cowsay.md)
- [R on Jupyter Notebook](docs/r_on_notebook.md)
- [Interfacing R with Python](docs/r_w_python.md)
