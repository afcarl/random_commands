# Random Commands

Before, I put a lot of files on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/). However, it started to
get mixing with random topics. So I just want to put all scripts in one place.

Check out these following markdown files.

- [Homebrew](homebrew.md)
- [Macports with Python](macports.md)
- [Python with Anaconda](anaconda.md)
- [PySpark](pyspark.md)
- [Vim](vim.md)
- [Git customization](git_customization.md)
